# nets
This project aims to serve as a basic implementation of PyTorch for educational purposes. It includes functionality for creating and training deep learning models, written entirely in Python.

## Installation & Configuration
You don't have to do anything special. Just clone the repository, add it to your project, and try it out!

## Modules
### Tensor
Contains all the code for creating our implementation of the PyTorch tensor class, which is a general list of any dimension to which backpropagation applies.

### NN
Contains all the deep learning layers needed to create various AI models. So far, we have implemented:
* `Linear`: The linear layer of logistic regresion.

## Additional Notes
This project is written in Python without any parallelization, so the performance of the modules is not comparable to PyTorch. Its sole purpose is to serve as a valuable tool for understanding how deep learning models work under the hood.

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements, suggestions, or addition to our cause.
